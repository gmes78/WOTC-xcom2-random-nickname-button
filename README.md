This is a version of [Thades' mod](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1188012104) that doesn't depend on the Shen's Last Gift DLC.

This mod adds a panel of five buttons to the Customize Soldier Info submenu: the buttons allow the user to tap into the in-game functions and generate new random names (first, last, and nicknames), a different country, and a new biography at their whim.

There's a config file that allows the user to reposition the button panel if they choose, and rather verbose instructions on just how that works.

This still requires the WoTC DLC.
